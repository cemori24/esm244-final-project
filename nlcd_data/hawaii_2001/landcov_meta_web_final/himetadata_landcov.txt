  Description:
    Abstract:
      The National Land Cover Database 2001 land cover layer for The Hawaiian mapping zone was produced through a cooperative project conducted by the Multi-Resolution Land Characteristics (MRLC) Consortium.  The MRLC Consortium is a partnership of federal agencies (www.mrlc.gov), consisting of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), the U.S. Forest Service (USFS), the National Park Service (NPS), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS).  One of the primary goals of the project is to generate a current, consistent, seamless, and accurate National Land cover Database (NLCD) circa 2001 for the United States at medium spatial resolution.  This landcover map and all documents pertaining to it are considered "provisional"  until a formal accuracy assessment can be conducted.  For a detailed definition and discussion on MRLC and the NLCD 2001 products, refer to Homer et al. (2004) and http://www.mrlc.gov/mrlc2k.asp.

      The NLCD 2001 is created by partitioning the U.S. into mapping zones.  A total of 66 mapping zones were delineated within the conterminous U.S. based on ecoregion and geographical characteristics, edge matching features and the size requirement of Landsat mosaics.  The Hawaiian Mapping zone encompasses the state of Hawaii.  Questions about the NLCD Hawaiian mapping zone can be directed to the NLCD 2001 land cover mapping team at the USGS/EROS, Sioux Falls, SD (605) 594-6151 or mrlc@usgs.gov.
    Purpose: The goal of this project is to provide the Nation with complete, current and consistent public domain information on its land use and land cover.

      Process_Description:
        This landcover was completed by NOAA coastal services center and is available for download in its original format here.  http://www.csc.noaa.gov/ccap/pacific/  This landcover data was crosswalked from the expanded NOAA classes to NLCD standard classes.
        Following the development of the best classification through decision tree modeling, additional steps were required to complete the final land cover product.  The four classes in urban and suburban areas were determined from the percent imperviousness mapping product (described in the next section).  The threshold for the four classes is: (1) developed open space (imperviousness < 20%), (2) low-intensity developed (imperviousness from 20 - 49%), (3) medium intensity developed (imperviousness from 50 -79%), and (4) high-intensity developed (imperviousness > 79%).  Other classes of forest and non-forest were combined with the urban classes to complete the land cover product.  Finally visual inspection of the classification was made with areas/pixels that were wrongly classified delineated first as an "area of interest" (AOI), subsequently then limited manual editing was done to eliminate the classification error within the AOI.

        The completed single pixel product was then generalized to a 1 acre (approximately 5 ETM+ 30 m  pixel patch) minimum mapping unit product using a "smart eliminate" algorithm. This aggregation program subsumes pixels from the single pixel level to a 5-pixel patch using a queens algorithm at doubling intervals. The algorithm consults a weighting matrix to guide merging of cover types by similarity, resulting in a product that preserves land cover logic as much as possible.
        Acquisition dates of Landsat ETM+ (TM) scenes used for land cover classification in Hawaiian zone are as follows:

Zoom tools are available that can be used to investigate areas of interest on the map interface.  The download tool allows the customer to capture layers from the map, utilizing the Seamless Data Distribution System process for downloading.  A request summary page is then generated with the download layers listed.  By clicking the "download" button on the summary page, a zipped file will be generated that can be saved on the customer's computer.  The file can then be unzipped and imported into various user software applications.
