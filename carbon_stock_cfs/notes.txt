Arturo: Attached are the C storage values for different compartments. 
I think it makes sense to only show the total in the graph 
(or above and below without worrying about live or dead), 
and then in a table show the values for each category, 
multiplied by the corresponding areas for each class. 
If possible, it would be good to either let the user adjust the values, 
or be able to upload their own spreadsheet with their values, 
whatever is easier for you to code.
For the uncertainty, consider +/- 30% for all values.
